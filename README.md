kaggle's largest ever machine learning competition.

Our goal
In this competition we are asked to predict if a customer will make a transaction or not regardless of the amount of money
transacted. Hence our goal is to solve a binary classification problem. In the data description you can see that the features 
given are numeric and anonymized. Furthermore the data seems to be artificial as they state that "the data has the same 
structure as our real data".

result- the prediction fetched an AUC OF .89
